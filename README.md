# split-video2frames

A Python script can be developed using OpenCV to decompose video files into individual frames.

To use this script, enter the path to the video you want to work with and the path where you want to save the images, and as an argument, you can use:

'--frame_interval' : interval between saved frames (e.g., 2 for every other frame). Defaults to 1 (every frame);

'--prefix' : prefix for the saved frame filenames. Defaults to "frame";

'--image_format' : image format to save the frames in (jpg, png, etc.). Defaults to "jpg".
